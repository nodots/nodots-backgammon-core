/**
 * RobotAIProvider Interface
 *
 * This interface defines the contract for AI providers that can execute
 * complete robot turns in a backgammon game. Implementations of this interface
 * are responsible for analyzing the game state, selecting optimal moves, and
 * executing the full sequence of moves for a robot player's turn.
 *
 * The separation of concerns is:
 * - CORE: Defines this interface and game rules
 * - AI: Implements this interface with specific AI strategies (GNU, Nodots, etc.)
 * - API: Calls CORE's executeRobotTurn which delegates to registered provider
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class GNUAIProvider implements RobotAIProvider {
 *   async executeRobotTurn(game: BackgammonGameMoving): Promise<BackgammonGameRolling> {
 *     // Use GNU Backgammon hints to determine and execute moves
 *     // Return updated game in rolling state for next player
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */

   * Takes a game in the 'moving' state where a robot player needs to make moves,
   * analyzes the position, selects and executes all moves for this turn, and
   * returns the game in 'rolling' state ready for the next player.
   *
   * @param game - The current game state with a robot as the active player
   * @returns Promise resolving to the updated game state after all moves are executed
   * @throws Error if the active player is not a robot
