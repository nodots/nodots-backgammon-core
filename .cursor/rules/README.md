**WORKFLOW:**

- Regular status updates every 15-30 seconds
- Always kill API server before starting
- Verify directory before running commands
- All tests must pass before completion
- Use exact bug status terminology

**API USAGE:**

- Use `api.games.start(player1Id, player2Id)` for game creation
- API routes: `<hostname>:<port>/api/v1/<route>`
